Creating a Python script for online collaboration depends on the specific type of collaboration you're aiming for, such as file sharing, real-time text editing, task management, or chat functionality. Here's a basic example that demonstrates how you can set up a real-time chat application using Python and websockets, which can be extended into a collaborative tool for team discussions or project management.

We'll use the websockets library for this.

Python Script for a Simple Chat Server and Client (using websockets)
1. Install necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install websockets
2. Chat Server Script (server.py)
python
Copy code
import asyncio
import websockets

connected_clients = set()

async def chat_server(websocket, path):
    # Add new client to the connected_clients set
    connected_clients.add(websocket)
    try:
        async for message in websocket:
            print(f"Received message: {message}")
            # Broadcast the message to all connected clients
            for client in connected_clients:
                if client != websocket:
                    await client.send(message)
    except websockets.ConnectionClosed as e:
        print(f"Connection closed: {e}")
    finally:
        # Remove the client from the set when the connection is closed
        connected_clients.remove(websocket)

start_server = websockets.serve(chat_server, "localhost", 6789)

print("Server started on ws://localhost:6789")
# Start the server and run forever
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
3. Chat Client Script (client.py)
python
Copy code
import asyncio
import websockets

async def chat_client():
    uri = "ws://localhost:6789"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        # Start a task to send messages
        async def send_message():
            while True:
                message = input("You: ")
                await websocket.send(message)

        # Start a task to receive messages
        async def receive_message():
            while True:
                message = await websocket.recv()
                print(f"Friend: {message}")

        await asyncio.gather(send_message(), receive_message())

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(chat_client())
Explanation:
server.py: This script runs the server, which listens for incoming websocket connections on localhost:6789. It handles broadcasting messages to all connected clients, maintaining a set of active clients.

client.py: This script connects to the chat server, allowing a user to send and receive messages in real-time using websockets. Messages are sent to the server, which then forwards them to all other connected clients.

How to run:
Run the server:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
Run the client on multiple terminals or machines (if networked):

bash
Copy code
python client.py
This simple chat app can be expanded into a real collaboration tool by adding features such as file sharing, group chats, and more complex UI using a web framework like Flask or Django. üòäüë®‚Äçüíª
